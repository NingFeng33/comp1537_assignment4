                <p class="title">Be careful, you may be one of them!</p>
                <P>A couple of decades ago I posed the “are we alone” question to <a
                        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/05/21/the-scientist-who-wrote-rings-around-the-earth/90769d12-d1de-4523-9ebd-5f6df05f8e93/"
                        target=_blank>Stephen Jay Gould</a>, the Harvard paleontologist and prodigious author of popular
                    science books. Gould had long thought through the question of the evolution of the human species in
                    the grand context of life on Earth over the course of 4 billion years. Gould argued quite
                    vociferously that if we were to start the whole biosphere over again from scratch, with primitive
                    forms, and rerun the process, the likelihood of human beings appearing again would be infinitesimal.
                    The real question, though, is not whether humans would arise a second time if we started from
                    scratch, but whether an intelligent species would.</P>
                <P>The Drake Equation is the handy tool for thinking through the probabilities. Developed by astronomer
                    Frank Drake in the early years of radio astronomy, it provides an estimate of the number of
                    extraterrestrial civilizations that are communicative. That is, if we turn an instrument, such as a
                    radio receiver, toward deep space, how likely is it that we will get a signal? The smart thing about
                    the Drake Equation is that it doesn't pretend to provide an answer, because many of the factors
                    aren't known. We don't know the likelihood of life appearing on a planet, or the likelihood that it
                    will evolve into intelligent, communicative life-forms that manage to stick around a long time.</P>
                <P>Back to Gould: When I asked him about intelligent life beyond Earth, he answered, “No data.” This was
                    true then, and remains true today, with the caveat that astronomers have discovered that planets are
                    common, and many appear to be small, rocky, Earthlike planets. The abundance of plausible habitats
                    for life boosts the odds that life is common, and therefore has plenty of opportunities to achieve —
                    through the trial-and-error of natural selection — complexity and perhaps intelligence.</P>

                <p>A <a
                        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11233172_Memory_distortion_in_people_reporting_abduction_by_aliens">2002
                        study</a> from academics at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School set out to probe what
                    exactly might lead to the formation of memories of alien abduction, focusing particularly on the
                    role of false recall and recognition</p>
                <p>For their investigation, the researchers recruited volunteers “who may have been contacted or
                    abducted by aliens” via local newspapers to participate in their memory study. These included 11
                    participants who had recovered memories of alien abduction, as well as 11 who believed unexplained
                    symptoms pointed to having been abducted, but felt they had repressed memories of the event. The
                    control group consisted of participants who did not believe they had been abducted by aliens.</p>

                <p>Participants listened to audio recordings of a series of word lists, each centring around a single,
                    non-presented “lure” word. For example, a list including words such as <em>sour</em>,
                    <em>candy</em>, <em>sugar</em>, and <em>bitter</em> would be associated with the word
                    <em>sweet</em>, which wouldn't be presented. After briefly studying the list, each of the
                    participants spent 30 seconds solving simple mathematical problems, before being asked to recall and
                    write down as many of the presented words as possible. They were then tested to see if they
                    recognised those previously presented words from a similar word list which also included new,
                    semantically related words. In addition, they also completed several questionnaires probing aspects
                    of mental health such as mood disorders, dissociative experiences, and schizotypy.

                <p class="title">UFOs and Aliens Among Us</p>
                <p>If UFOs were visiting our world, where were these extraterrestrials? Could they be hidden among us?
                    Comic books and television illustrates how the possibility of extraterrestrial visitors reflected
                    anxieties of that era. </p>
                <p>The 1962 comic <a href="/item/acd2008000008/PP/"><em>There are Martians Among Us</em></a>, from
                    Amazing Fantasy #15, illustrates the way fear of extraterrestrials could reflect Cold War anxieties.
                    In the comic, a search party gathers around a landed alien craft, but it can find no sign of alien
                    beings. Radio announcers warn those nearby to stay indoors. The action shifts to a husband and wife
                    as he prepares to leave their home despite a television announcer's warning to remain indoors. As he
                    waves goodbye he reminds his wife to stay inside. The wife however decides to slip out to the store
                    and is attacked and dragged off. The husband returns home and finding it empty runs towards the
                    telephone in a panic. In a twist, the anxious husband reveals that he and his wife are the Martians.
                </p>
                <p>The fear that there might be alien enemies in our midst resonates with fears of Soviets and
                    communists from the McCarthy era. Ultimately, in this story, the humans are the ones who accost and
                    capture the alien woman. The shift in perspective puts the humans in the position of the monsters.

                <p>Fravor says it wasn&rsquo;t long before his curiosity got the best of him and he decided to get a
                    closer look. As Fravor began descending toward the water, the craft surfaced, rapidly ascended, and
                    began mirroring Fravor&rsquo;s flight pattern. Then, in an instant, it zipped past the nose of
                    Fravor&rsquo;s jet and disappeared.<br></p>
                <p>When Fravor and the other pilots got back to the USS<em> </em><em>Nimitz</em>, they shared their
                    experiences with the rest of the crew. Shortly afterward, another pilot took off in search of the
                    UFO&mdash;and succeeded. This pilot managed to get a lock on the Tic Tac, which happens to be the
                    footage seen here. </p>
